# OwnerOccupancyTaxDuplication
Runs code (and has raw data) to detect owners claiming owner occupancy tax credits 2+ times in Cuyahoga County.

Note that Owner_Details.csv is zipped because the csv is too large for github (lots of empty cells to be compressed).

This work was created in July 2025.

The City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, any other municipalities in Cuyahoga County, Case Western Reserve, and any and all afiliates thereof are free to use in part or in full, with or without further modificiation, any of the within code. I take no responsibility for the accuracy of my code, or any results produced by itâ€”it is _not_ a 100% reliable list of owners claiming the owner occupancy tax credit multiple times (for one thing, two different people can have the same name), and should be used as a starting point, not an ending point in such an analysis.
